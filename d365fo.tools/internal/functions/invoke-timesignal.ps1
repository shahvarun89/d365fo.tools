    .SYNOPSIS
        Handle time measurement
        
    .DESCRIPTION
        Handle time measurement from when a cmdlet / function starts and ends
        
        Will write the output to the verbose stream (Write-PSFMessage -Level Verbose)
        
    .PARAMETER Start
        Switch to instruct the cmdlet that a start time registration needs to take place
        
    .PARAMETER End
        Switch to instruct the cmdlet that a time registration has come to its end and it needs to do the calculation
        
    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Invoke-TimeSignal -Start
        
        This will start the time measurement for any given cmdlet / function
        
    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Invoke-TimeSignal -End
        
        This will end the time measurement for any given cmdlet / function.
        The output will go into the verbose stream.
